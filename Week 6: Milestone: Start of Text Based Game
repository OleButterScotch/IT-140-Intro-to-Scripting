# A dictionary for the simplified dragon text game
# The dictionary links a room to other rooms.
rooms = {
    'Great Hall': {'South': 'Bedroom'},
    'Bedroom': {'North': 'Great Hall', 'East': 'Cellar'},
    'Cellar': {'West': 'Bedroom'}
}

direction = ['North', 'South', 'East', 'West']  # Defining directions used for navigation

Creating a function for my instructions
Setting instruction for user to exit game when desired

def instructions(room):
    print('You are currently in the {}'.format(room))
    print('You can move between rooms using the following directions:')
    for direct in direction:
        print('{}'.format(direct), end=' ')
    print('\nTo stop the game, type: exit.')

Creating function for in room outputs

def in_room(room, direct):
    where_to = rooms[room]
    if direct not in where_to:
        print('You cannot go that way in the {}.'.format(room))
        return room

    print('Changing rooms to the {}'.format(where_to[direct]))
    return where_to[direct]

stop = 'go'
current_room = 'Great Hall'

Creating my while loop for room movement
As long as user doesn't type exit, loop will continue

while stop != 'exit':
    user_input = input(instructions(current_room))
    if user_input == 'exit':
       break
    if user_input not in direction:
        print('{} is not a valid input.'.format(user_input))
        continue
    if current_room == 'Great Hall':
        current_room = in_room('Great Hall', user_input)
    elif current_room == 'Bedroom':
        current_room = in_room('Bedroom', user_input)
    elif current_room == 'Cellar':
        current_room = in_room('Cellar', user_input)
